# Password Generator

Simple web application for generating random passwords. The user can chosse between 4 character sets and can also set the length. The password can then be copied to clipboard.

This project was designed and programmed by me.

    -   uglify

-   ClipBoard API
-   Styling checkmarks and sliders
